**SoBioS - Sobol' Indices for Biological Systems** is an easy to run Matlab code used for Sobol' indices-based global sensitivity analysis of Biological Systems. The implementation follows an educational style, to make its use very intuitive. 

This package includes the following modules:

- SoBioS_CaseName.m - main file for the simulation (use servaral resourses from UQLab package);
- QoI_CaseName.m - function to compute the Quantity of Interest (QoI).


## Software History

This code was developed as a pedagogical tool to teach the basics of global sensitivity analysis of biological systems via Sobol' indices. A tutorial explaining the theory and practical aspects behind **SoBioS** package is provided in the following book chapter:

## UQLab dependency

In order to use the **SoBioS** code, it is necessary to have UQLab package installed:
